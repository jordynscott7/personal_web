However, it is unclear whether different populations exposed to similar anthropogenic environments adapt in similar ways. In this study, we used human-commensal populations of Oceanic Swallows as a model to assess how birds may adapt to living in close proximity to humans. To assess whether different, independently commensal populations exhibit evidence of parallel adaptation to human environments, we used FST, Pi, and Dxy to identify outlier regions differentiated between commensal and non-commensal populations. Aiding Sam Sudoko, Biology master’s student, I conducted these analyses and found several shared regions of high Fst in commensal populations that suggest parallel selection across different, independently commensal populations.
